        step-by-step recipe – great for using up leftover chicken!


        <h2 class="ingredients"> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>85g smoked bacon lardons</li>
            <li>1 large onion, halved and finely chopped</li>
            <li>250g chestnut mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
            <li>300g arborio risotto rice</li>
            <li>150ml dry white wine</li>
            <li>1.4l hot chicken stock</li>
            <li>140g cooked chicken, chopped</li>
            <li>50g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
            <li>½ small pack of flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the butter in a large pan. Add the lardons and fry for 5
                mins over a low-medium heat. Stir in the onion and fry for 10
                mins more until the onion is soft but not coloured.</li>

            <li>Stir in the mushrooms and continue cooking, stirring, for 5
                mins. Stir in the risotto rice and cook over a medium heat for
                2 mins until the rice has started to turn translucent.</li>

            <li>Pour in the wine and allow it to bubble away over the heat.
                Pour in a quarter of the chicken stock and set a timer for 20
                mins.</li>

            <li>Continue cooking, stirring very frequently, topping up with a
                splash more stock as it gets absorbed – this is best done in
                three more stages, until the rice is cooked and most of the
                stock has been absorbed (you may not need all the stock). The
                texture now should be creamy, like rice pudding.</li>

            <li>Stir through the chicken, warm briefly, then turn off the heat.
                Stir through the parmesan and parsley, cover and leave to rest
                for 5 mins to allow more liquid to be absorbed into the rice.
                Season to taste and serve with extra parmesan, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
